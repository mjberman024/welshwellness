              I help children, adolescents, adults, caregivers, and people
              wanting to grow their families. I have a wealth of experience,
              training, and knowledge in many areas, and my goals are to work
              with my client to reach their highest potential. My therapeutic
              approach is focused on a collaborative effort to identify
              individual strengths and needs, develop meaningful goals, and to
              explore the necessary steps to attain those goals. My approach
              leads to increased self-esteem, learning, and attaining the
              supports that are out there â€” and teaching you to learn how to
              transition to a positive lens.

                  Erin loves skiing, yoga, and spending her time with her
                  family. She is also a huge believer in counseling and isn not
                  one to shy away from going to her own counselor. She loves to

                  end, and that is what makes her so passionate about counseling
                  and helping her clients achieve success no matter what out of
                  the box idea it takes. Erin is also married and has two young
                  sons.
